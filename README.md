## üîç Understanding Arbitrage

### What is Arbitrage?
Arbitrage occurs when you can guarantee a profit regardless of the race outcome by backing different selections at different bookmakers.

### Types of Arbitrage

#### 1. Back/Lay Arbitrage (Betfair)
- Back a selection at high odds
- Lay the same selection at lower odds
- Profit from the difference minus commission

#### 2. Cross-Platform Arbitrage
- Back at a bookmaker with high odds
- Lay on Betfair at lower odds
- Profit from bookmaker overpricing

### Arbitrage Example
```
Dog A: Bookmaker offers 4.00, Betfair lay at 3.80
¬£100 bet on bookmaker: Returns ¬£400 if wins
¬£105.26 lay on Betfair: Liability ¬£294.74 if loses

Profit regardless: ¬£5.26 (5.26% return)
```
